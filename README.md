Just clone and load into Unity, load the scene, click play, enter an equation, and click the Parse button.

WASD moves around the scene.
Arrows keys + PageUp/PageDn change the camera angle.

It has a simple Math Expression parser that I was building from scratch before I started learning about LALR Parsers and B+Trees. I may replace the parser at some point, but I'm more interested in making a SQL parser for my database project.

Things I'd like to do with this project are allow more functionality for things like integrals, derivatives, partial derivatives, adding in variables, and a clickable history. 

Not quite a MATLAB replacement, and not intended to be. There are some scripts in the "Extras" folder where I was starting to play around with things like DFTs.
